# Sequence-Prediction-with-CNNs

Morphological operations like dilation and erosion are foundational in binary image processing, yet their sequential application to transform one binary matrix into another remains
an underexplored domain. This study investigates whether a convolutional neural network
(CNN) can predict the sequence of transformations required to iteratively transform a binary input matrix A into a target output matrix B. The transformations are defined over
a hypothesis class comprising 16 distinct operations, derived from applying dilation and
erosion with eight unique structuring elements.

To evaluate this, we developed a synthetic dataset of binary matrix transformations, applying sequences of operations using predefined structuring elements, including cross, plus,
rhombus, square, and directional line kernels. A CNN model was trained to classify the
next transformation in a sequence, leveraging convolutional layers, batch normalization,
and global average pooling for efficient spatial feature extraction. The model’s performance
was assessed using two metrics: next-in-sequence prediction accuracy and the ability to
reconstruct full transformation sequences.

Experimental results demonstrate the model’s robustness in generalizing across varying matrix sizes and sequence lengths. Notably, while the next-operation prediction accuracy was
limited, the model achieved a remarkable 54.7% success rate in generating complete transformation sequences via alternative paths, often discovering shorter paths to achieve the
target matrix. These findings reveal the potential of neural networks to approximate and
optimize complex binary matrix transformations, opening avenues for further research into
sequence learning and abstraction in image processing tasks.
